- JSON Serialisation -

Alot of work deals with communication between servers and webpages, as such JSON strings get used pretty extensively. This test looks to see how you can turn a JSON string into a usable object in C#

Test Steps:
1) The JSON string should loaded in automatically for you
2) Parse the JSON string into a List<ExampleObject> and print the count of the list.
3) Find all the objects with a SearchReference of 1 and print them to screen.

Note:
Feel free to add new libraries to the project if required.
