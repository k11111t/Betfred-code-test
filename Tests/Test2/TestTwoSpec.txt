- Dealing with multiple entities -

Using what you created in Test One, we're going to expand it to deal with multiple Customers.

Test Steps:
1) Create 3 new Customers and save them to the database.
2) Get the 1st Customer from the database and print their name on screen.
3) Update the 2nd customer and change their name in the database. Regrab that customer from the database then print their name.
4) Delete the 3rd Customer from the database. Print all of the customers names in the database to show it has removed.
5) Delete the remaining Customers from the database. Print all of the customers names from the database to show it is clear.
