-Betfred Code Test-

This project should compile and run - if not, ensure you have .Net 6 installed.

These tests are designed to see the quaity of your programming and your problem solving capabilities.
Within the 'Tests' folder you'll see 4 sub folders each with a .cs class in it, do all your logic in there in the methods defined (feel free to add further methods if you need to.)

I've included a rudementary example (ExampleTest.cs) with some basic concepts in it. It's by no means perfect but it should give you an idea of how the db access is configured.

A few basic rules:

1) Don't remove any of the logging that is in already (it's there just to make it easier for me to track your results)
2) When logging results, please use ConsoleLog.LogResult - it just shows up green with spacing so, again, I can see the results a little clearer.
3) Don't be afraid to add new packages if you think it's necessary - although I'll likely ask about your choice if you do and why you think it's a best fit.
4) Try to be as efficient as possible, day to day we can deal with relatively high volumes of data so performance is key.
5) Don't stress yourself out with it, if you get in a jam don't panic and do what you're able.
